1
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:08,875
( music playing )

2
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:25,892
Duncan Muggoch:
Although this is TV,

3
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:29,295
it's TV in a scale that
is beyond anything else.

4
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,904
Peter Welter Soler:
It's the most successful TV
show in the world right now.

5
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:40,373
It is special.
Very, very special.

6
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:46,179
Chris Newman:
Today we're shooting
in Croatia,

7
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:47,947
they're shooting
in Belfast,

8
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:51,785
and they're preparing
for shooting in Seville
down in Spain.

9
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:54,320
Whatever hand you're dealt,
you have to go with it

10
00:00:54,032 --> 00:00:56,068
because the show
can't stop.

11
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:00,727
Bernie Caulfield:
I think we're the only ones
in the world

12
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,529
that shoot
with two units

13
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:05,665
at the same time
all season long.

14
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:08,234
If one of those spokes
in the wheel are missing,

15
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:10,136
it's gonna collapse.

16
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:12,213
Director:
And, action!

17
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,874
( crowd cheering )

18
00:01:34,026 --> 00:01:36,229
Morning.

19
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:39,099
How are you all?

20
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,136
My name is Duncan Muggoch
and I'm the UK line producer

21
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:44,771
for Croatia and Spain,
or what we also call

22
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:48,708
the southern locations
for "Game of Thrones"
season five.

23
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:51,644
This is my second season.
I did Croatia last year.

24
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:54,280
And this year

25
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:54,280
we've obviously got Spain
thrown into it as well.

26
00:01:54,028 --> 00:01:56,164
So I'm line producing

27
00:01:54,028 --> 00:01:56,164
both of them this year.

28
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:59,519
And even though
last year was big,
this one's even bigger.

29
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:08,027
My name is Chris Newman.
I'm one of the producers
on "Game of Thrones."

30
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:11,731
I fulfill a function

31
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:11,731
here of planning how
the two units work

32
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:15,335
and drift in between
the sets, the locations,
and the different countries.

33
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,036
So how was yesterday?
All right?

34
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:19,873
- Yes. Yeah, it was good.
It was really good, yeah.
- Yes? Good.

35
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:21,808
Newman:
We start shooting
at the end of July.

36
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,544
99% of the crew
have been here before.

37
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:26,913
So when you start day one,

38
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:29,449
it feels like day 301

39
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,050
in a good way.

40
00:02:31,005 --> 00:02:33,052
As this is going on here,
over in Spain

41
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:35,621
we have Peter
who runs Fresco Films.

42
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:39,792
He's new to this year,
so he doesn't know quite
how manic it can get.

43
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:46,533
My name is

44
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:46,533
Peter Welter Soler.

45
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:48,268
I'm the Spanish line producer

46
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:48,268
on this show.

47
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:50,403
The production booklets,
are we getting them tonight?

48
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:52,500
Welter Soler:
We have two weeks left
before everybody arrives.

49
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,608
And then two days later,
we start shooting.

50
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:59,112
I'd be lying
if I said the stress level
is not increasing,

51
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:01,781
because obviously
this is very important
for all of us.

52
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:04,050
Doing it for the first time,
we want to please everybody.

53
00:03:04,005 --> 00:03:05,473
We want to do a great job.

54
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:08,655
This is actually maybe not
the calm before the storm.

55
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:11,257
It is the rehearsal
before the show.
( chuckles )

56
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:24,103
We're heading from our
unit base into Dubrovnik,
into the old town.

57
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:27,120
Filming here
is quite different
from filming in Belfast

58
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:29,676
'cause the logistics over here
are very different.

59
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,844
One of the logistical
problems of Dubrovnik

60
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:34,280
is it's such a tight,
small, old city

61
00:03:34,028 --> 00:03:36,931
that we can't get
our big vehicles actually
into the town

62
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:38,685
just 'cause the streets
are so narrow.

63
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,420
It's just one
of the challenges
that we face

64
00:03:40,042 --> 00:03:41,977
filming in a city
like this.

65
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:52,543
You can't take vehicles

66
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:52,543
within the old walls,

67
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:55,868
so everything has
to get taken by Sherpas

68
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:57,935
up to a location today
which is probably

69
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:01,841
one of the furthest
and trickiest you could
get to in the whole city.

70
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:03,710
A little rule that I have
for myself on location,

71
00:04:03,071 --> 00:04:05,807
and this is never go up
empty-handed or come down
empty-handed.

72
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:09,749
Now it's just a load of stairs
all the way up to the top.

73
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,618
Hello, gorgeous.

74
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,119
Good. Good, good.

75
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:15,188
Muggoch:

76
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:15,188
The principal actors
are just arriving on set

77
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,824
to rehearse.

78
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:20,093
They will do a rehearsal
with the director first,

79
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,262
and then they'll do
a full crew rehearsal,

80
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,365
which is when they'll place
where the cameras are gonna go
and everything like that.

81
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:28,568
Man:
Okay, guys, give us
the set, please.

82
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:38,745
Hey, Joseph.
How are you?
Nice to see you.

83
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:40,980
Newman:
Episode one and two
have been in Croatia.

84
00:04:40,098 --> 00:04:42,701
They've done most
of their filming and they're
back here finishing up

85
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,286
now that Emilia
has finished in Croatia.

86
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,354
( growling )

87
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:50,623
- Do that.
Just growl at one point.
- ( growls )

88
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:54,327
So this morning,
episode one and two
with Mike Slovis directing

89
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:58,398
are setting up to do
their first scene this season
in Dany's penthouse.

90
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:00,867
Morning, everybody.
Hello.

91
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:04,370
Newman:
So it's right at the beginning
of the-- season five

92
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:06,673
and it's the first time
Dany gets an inkling

93
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:09,103
of what's going on in Meereen
under her new rule.

94
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,378
And then do you want it
to be a boom,

95
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:15,214
I've decided
I will not have them?

96
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:16,783
Or do you want it
to be kind of like--

97
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:18,418
- No, I think
it's more gentle.
- It's gentle?

98
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,153
It is gentle?
Okay, lovely. Yeah.

99
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,288
I have shot
mostly in Belfast.

100
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:25,491
I have shot several days

101
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:25,491
in Croatia

102
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,558
and I am going to shoot

103
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,558
in Seville.

104
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,962
Teach them a better way.

105
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:31,631
It sounds like something
Jorah would have said.

106
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:33,833
Slovis:
Moving to a foreign
country on this show

107
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,569
is not as disruptive
as you might think

108
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:38,671
because one
of the two crews

109
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:41,874
that you've already
worked with here goes there.

110
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:43,910
So the first thing that happens
when you walk on the set

111
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:44,692
is that you see
familiar faces.

112
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,915
Kay Bilk:
My priority today
is looking after Emilia

113
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:50,850
because she's come

114
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:50,850
from Croatia,

115
00:05:50,085 --> 00:05:52,754
so we're matching continuity

116
00:05:50,085 --> 00:05:52,754
to that country.

117
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,455
They send
their photos to us

118
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:57,990
so that we can do the same
as they've been doing.

119
00:05:57,099 --> 00:05:59,402
Rosalia Culora:
There's two departments
filming at the same time,

120
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:02,195
so it's imperative

121
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:02,195
that things like wigs,

122
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:05,252
continuity photos

123
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:05,252
all travel together

124
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,862
and that every member
of the team is aware
of what the look is,

125
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:10,937
because if we do
have to take over
someone's artist,

126
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:13,906
we know exactly
what we're doing
and there's no mess-ups

127
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:16,008
when we're watching
the show, hopefully.

128
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:17,710
Slovis:
Let's do one
for camera, please.

129
00:06:17,071 --> 00:06:18,740
Okay.

130
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,748
Man:
Let's have it quiet
for rehearsal, please.

131
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:24,350
And that means everybody
in here, thank you.

132
00:06:24,035 --> 00:06:25,403
Action.

133
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,253
So the only thing
that gave him pride

134
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:29,722
was knowing
there was someone
lower than he was.

135
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:42,902
- Morning.
- Morning.

136
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,303
- How are you?
- Good.

137
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:46,272
- Morning, Duncan.
Morning, Mr. Muggoch.
- Morning.

138
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:50,176
Oh, I want

139
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:50,176
to talk to Peter today
or maybe you can.

140
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:52,445
Peter Welter?

141
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:52,445
Yeah, no, I'm talking
with him.

142
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,514
About Córdoba bridge
and the drone.

143
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:56,749
Muggoch:
As far as I'm concerned,
Bernie is "Game of Thrones."

144
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,886
I've never met a producer
that cares for a crew
as much as she does.

145
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:02,755
She's an incredible woman
to work for, actually,

146
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,357
and everybody loves her.

147
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:05,691
And she keeps
everything together.

148
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:07,527
And do they want
to clear a place
in that?

149
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:09,095
So the bridge
has to be closed.

150
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,596
That's--
I'm checking on.

151
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,932
Along with David and Dan,
she's the executive producer.

152
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,301
David and Dan
are obviously-- you know,
they're the creators of it.

153
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:16,536
It's their baby.

154
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:18,204
Bernie is the one that keeps
this show running.

155
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:20,840
Sometimes David and Dan
will be with us.

156
00:07:20,084 --> 00:07:23,287
Sometimes they are separate
so that they can both
be on the set,

157
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:26,312
depending
what the scene might be,

158
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:29,115
will watch rehearsal,
give their notes on the scene,

159
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,751
and then a lot

160
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,751
of times we're discussing
what is in advance.

161
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,653
As you can imagine,

162
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,653
with 10 episodes,

163
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:35,221
that we're

164
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:35,221
constantly prepping.

165
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:39,926
Much like our

166
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:39,926
characters, we will go
from the amazing Daznak

167
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:41,761
right into
the amazing Hardhome.

168
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:43,729
Caulfield:
I usually have a nice list
for them every day.

169
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:47,266
They almost cringe
when they see me starting
to come towards them

170
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:49,902
and open my book to start
asking my questions.

171
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:53,940
But they're fantastically
collaborative with all of us.

172
00:07:53,094 --> 00:07:56,430
Today, they're having
a big Hardhome meeting
up in Belfast.

173
00:07:57,276 --> 00:08:00,283
- They got the notes?
- Yes. Yeah.

174
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:02,915
Caulfield:
When we're shooting
in different countries,

175
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:04,684
it's about a constant
communication

176
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:07,220
between the producers
in each country.

177
00:08:07,022 --> 00:08:10,225
I'm gonna follow Nutter
over to Spain early.

178
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:14,360
You're staying here
through Illyrio's, right?

179
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:15,471
Are we doing a charter
to Sevilla?

180
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:18,231
We are, yes,
but I'm going to
leave ahead of time.

181
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:19,632
Yeah, which goes
on the 8th.

182
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:21,234
I'll go on the charter
this time.

183
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:23,603
- Hope there's a seat for me.
- There'll be a seat for you.

184
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:25,738
You can have
Bernie's seat.
( laughs )

185
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:29,442
In a week, we will all
take off in a charter

186
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:33,379
to go to Spain and that is now
starting to come very close.

187
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:35,515
After they have
their big scout today,

188
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,951
then we'll have
more information
to go off of for that.

189
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:42,754
( birds chirping )

190
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:45,309
Welter Soler:

191
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:45,309
We're in the royal palaces
of Seville

192
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:48,761
called the Real Alcázar,
which are palaces built

193
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:51,664
by Peter the Horrible
in the 13th century.

194
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:54,767
It's one of the most visited
monuments in Spain.

195
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:58,304
The Alcázar will be, like,
the water gardens of Dorne.

196
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:01,331
Since Dorne is a new world
that's just come into
the show--

197
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:03,009
it was introduced
in the fourth season,

198
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:04,544
but we didn't
really see it--

199
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,246
now in the fifth season,
they will finally get to see

200
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:08,981
the Kingdom of Dorne.

201
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:12,018
- ( speaking Spanish )

202
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:12,018
- Good morning once again.

203
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:14,220
Welter Soler:

204
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:14,220
It is difficult to shoot
in a place like that

205
00:09:14,022 --> 00:09:17,459
because it was obviously
not built as a set,

206
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:20,026
but built for a purpose,
a different purpose than ours.

207
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:22,161
( speaking Spanish )

208
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,400
Some of the places,
as you see in the balcony,
for instance,

209
00:09:27,004 --> 00:09:29,973
I mean, you can't possibly
get some of the gear up there

210
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:31,871
because the staircase
is too narrow.

211
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:33,439
So we have to get
a crane in--

212
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,007
Genie Booms, cranes,
platforms--

213
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:37,343
in order to haul
that material up there.

214
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:39,478
( speaking Spanish )

215
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:55,895
- It's tricky, you know?
- Okay.

216
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:58,464
It's not like
a back lot studio shoot.

217
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:00,533
First and second
shooting day is up here.

218
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,068
And then we move down
to the garden.

219
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,970
We'll get control
of the garden,
I'm assuming?

220
00:10:03,097 --> 00:10:06,834
As far as you told me,
we have the entire garden
area for us, correct?

221
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:10,276
- Yes, I have this note here.
- It's pretty amazing.

222
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,813
Welter Soler: They have,
like, an average of 8,000
tourists in here every day.

223
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:17,950
To see it, like, empty
and have it just for us
is just a privilege.

224
00:10:17,095 --> 00:10:19,172
Wherever you go, there's always

225
00:10:17,095 --> 00:10:19,172
gonna be a challenge

226
00:10:20,072 --> 00:10:23,108
because you're in

227
00:10:20,072 --> 00:10:23,108
a new place both culturally
and logistically.

228
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:25,324
We'll have to find
a compromise

229
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:26,859
where we can work
together with the palace.

230
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:28,861
We're the foreigners
coming into their country,

231
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:30,262
trying to put
this project together.

232
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:32,299
I have to say they're being
extremely nice,

233
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,434
which is-- so we need
to make sure that our--

234
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:38,571
which they always are--
but our crew are very careful

235
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:41,340
in this delicate location.

236
00:10:41,034 --> 00:10:43,103
Welter Soler;
And what they're doing
for us is unique as well.

237
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,678
It's never been locked off
like this for anybody.

238
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,279
All right, so will you go
and check the others?

239
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,182
- Sure.
- Because I think we're
running a bit late now.

240
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:04,030
We're now driving up
to a little village
called Magheramorne

241
00:11:04,003 --> 00:11:08,340
in which there is
a quarry that's been there
for a number of years now.

242
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:10,536
And in season one

243
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:13,005
we built the set
of Castle Black there.

244
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,707
Because there's a lake
in the quarry,

245
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:17,243
in season two
we built the battlements
of King's Landing

246
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:18,878
for the Battle
of Blackwater

247
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:20,846
with Stannis's boats
attacking.

248
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:24,517
It's still standing,
although it's looking
a bit worn these days.

249
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,604
Now we're driving up
to have a look at a set
mid-construction

250
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:30,389
of a fishing village
set north of the Wall.

251
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:33,426
We'll begin to see
how that's taking shape
this morning.

252
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,529
The set that we see

253
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,529
down here,

254
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,498
it's a fishing village

255
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,498
that is a protected
fishing village.

256
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:41,300
It's not a military
establishment.

257
00:11:41,003 --> 00:11:43,706
It was designed to be
somewhere where people

258
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:45,771
had a living off the sea.

259
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:48,007
So we needed the water,
which is why we put it

260
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:50,676
on the edge
of the reservoir here.

261
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:52,678
The fantastic thing

262
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:52,678
about the Hardhome set

263
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:57,216
is we're building something

264
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:57,216
that is so far north this time

265
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,618
that what we get to do
is create a fishing village

266
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:01,787
that is exactly
as the name describes.

267
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:03,889
It's Hardhome.
What we've been doing

268
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,991
both in concepts
and in models

269
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:09,662
is looking at the location
out in Magheramorne

270
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:11,597
and created what we need
for the action,

271
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:15,434
which is a longhouse
in which a lot of action
takes place.

272
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:17,303
And then we have
the landing area,

273
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:20,339
which we're able to use
the lake that exists
in Magheramorne.

274
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:24,443
And so through
having those sort of
necessary requirements,

275
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:27,446
we can then build
this sort of tent city

276
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:29,415
that will be created
out there.

277
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,650
So I had this good idea,

278
00:12:31,065 --> 00:12:33,234
which I need
to pitch, I guess,

279
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:36,836
which is to hold
onto that shot.

280
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:40,026
Miguel Sapochnik:
The director can now see
the bones of the whole set,

281
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:43,763
so he's gonna walk through
the set and start mapping out

282
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,832
where all the things that
he's imagined will take place.

283
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:48,909
If the plan to do that shot--
it's the boater's
point of view,

284
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,703
so it's looking
through the fence.

285
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,104
Sapochnik:
So anything at this point

286
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,173
that the director
would like to change,

287
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:56,408
this is the time that he has

288
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:56,408
to turn around and say,

289
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:58,677
"Well, could I put the door

290
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:58,677
in the hut over here?"

291
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:02,014
and, "Could I have this
a bit higher?" or so on.

292
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:04,550
Good, so, yeah,
we good with this?

293
00:13:04,055 --> 00:13:06,824
- Yeah.
- Rock and roll, so...

294
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:10,222
- shall we have a look...
- Look at this edge here
and see if that works.

295
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:12,057
Newman:
"Game of Thrones"
is a big event,

296
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:13,659
and what you mustn't do

297
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:17,296
is get put off
by the bigness of it.

298
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,865
The thing to do
is to come in and say,

299
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:22,001
"All I've got to worry about
is the 16x9.

300
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:25,237
What's in that frame."
It must be like parachuting.

301
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:27,273
Don't worry about
the height you're jumping,

302
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:29,308
just make sure
the parachute works.

303
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:32,044
( crew chatting )

304
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:38,884
It doesn't have

305
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:38,884
to be a sparrow.

306
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:42,755
Muggoch:
Today we've got about
128 extras out

307
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:44,390
and then everything
that goes with that,

308
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:46,241
which is the extra hair people,
makeup people,

309
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,694
costume people that have
to deal with all of that.

310
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:51,430
Nina Ayres:
Crowds start dressing
about 5:00 this morning.

311
00:13:51,043 --> 00:13:53,120
And then just in conjunction
with hair and makeup,

312
00:13:54,002 --> 00:13:55,637
we're just sort of working

313
00:13:54,002 --> 00:13:55,637
around each other.

314
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,137
And then everybody

315
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,137
travelled to set about 7:30

316
00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:59,338
to be all set for 8:00.

317
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,273
Just need to take

318
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,273
your blankets off, guys,

319
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:03,275
so we can look

320
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:03,275
at your costumes, please.

321
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:04,810
Muggoch:
Mark Mylod is the director,

322
00:14:04,081 --> 00:14:06,650
and he's now going
to select the extras

323
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:09,448
that he wants to feature
in the scene.

324
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:12,084
Yep, this gentleman.

325
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:12,084
And one other lady.

326
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:14,353
It changed a bit this morning
because people had to look

327
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,889
a bit poorer than
we'd originally intended.

328
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:19,992
I'd just like to maybe
darken a couple of teeth
or something.

329
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:22,561
A bit of the teeth black,
you know, just one
or two of those.

330
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:25,030
And maybe-- okay,
the skin's pretty good.

331
00:14:25,003 --> 00:14:27,005
Just a little
less healthy.

332
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,535
And so it was a bit
of a scramble trying
to get everybody

333
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,438
broken down enough
to look a bit poorer
than they had done.

334
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:33,806
And it's still happening.

335
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:35,708
People are still
getting dirtied up
as we speak.

336
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,576
- Thank you, guys.
Well done.
- Brilliant.

337
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:40,012
- Thank you.
See you soon.
- Thank you.

338
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:44,950
We had more than
86,000 applications

339
00:14:44,095 --> 00:14:47,399
to be a background extra
in the show.

340
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:51,657
People from
not only all over Spain,

341
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:53,192
but all over Europe,
even from California,

342
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:54,994
from Argentina,
from South Africa,

343
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:57,096
wanting to come
to the casting,

344
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:59,131
wanting to be part
of "Game of Thrones."

345
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:02,101
- Hello.

346
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:02,101
- How are you?

347
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:04,003
- Good.

348
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:04,003
- Peter. Buenos días.

349
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:06,005
- Buenos días.
- Buenas tardes.

350
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:08,574
- Oh, buenas tardes.
- Buenas tardes
is the afternoon.

351
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,609
Maybe you just got up.

352
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:12,211
I just had a siesta.

353
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:14,914
- Okay, then it's
good morning again.
- Thank you.

354
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,716
There's gonna be
about 1,000 costumes
to do 600 extras.

355
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:19,818
Stephen O'Rawe:
Because it's such
a major operation,

356
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:23,222
we're doing something
like 50, 60 fittings a day,
which normally we do 30.

357
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:26,225
We fit everybody here,
males, females, in and out.

358
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:28,727
We do guards, slaves.
There's a rogue slave.

359
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:30,963
Welter Soler:
There's a slave over there.
Hello, slave.

360
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:32,665
O'Rawe:
They process down here

361
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,433
and these guys
put on the hair.

362
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:37,569
Jenny puts on makeup
and they do their magic.

363
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:39,705
We're moving around
very quickly.

364
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:42,174
We're shooting in three

365
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:42,174
or four different places

366
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:43,809
all straight

367
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:43,809
after each other.

368
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:46,886
But we, like, have to go

369
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:46,886
in advance and prep
600, 700 people

370
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:51,483
all ready for a camera
that moves behind us.

371
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:52,518
We're basically set here.

372
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:55,454
I like when things
are just smooth.

373
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:10,135
Muggoch:
We've got Lena Headey
and Jonathan Pryce today.

374
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:13,172
We're shooting a scene here
from episode three

375
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:15,908
which is what we're calling
the soup kitchen,

376
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:18,210
which is a kind of
rundown area

377
00:16:18,021 --> 00:16:19,623
behind the Sept of Baelor.

378
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,247
And it's a scene
where Cersei is looking

379
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:23,916
to have a conversation
with the High Sparrow

380
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,085
who is a whole new
character.

381
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:27,486
We've got

382
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:27,486
a beautiful courtyard

383
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,121
which is actually

384
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,121
a former convent.

385
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:32,624
And we are disguising it

386
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:32,624
with a lot of awnings

387
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:36,328
and a lot of ground cover
on the floor.

388
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,897
And it's supposed to be
a really shocking place

389
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:40,933
where Cersei encounters
the poverty

390
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:43,335
that she has managed to ignore
for most of her time

391
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,636
living in King's Landing.

392
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:46,839
I'm standing there
looking butch and macho.

393
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,742
- I do a lot of that.
- Man: Can you show us?

394
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,446
- That's it. That's it.
- There's no...

395
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:56,448
- No jiggling?
- No, that's it.

396
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:58,283
If I jiggle, I sound
like "Jingle Bells."

397
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:00,185
So I can't actually move.
I'm not allowed to move.

398
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,787
I have to stand still.

399
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:10,396
Muggoch:
From walking about,
we're in every street there is.

400
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:12,264
It's only started
a few days ago,

401
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:14,433
so we haven't been here
long enough yet

402
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:17,169
to really cause chaos,
but it'll come.

403
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:20,196
Dubrovnik is understandably
a big tourist attraction,

404
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:23,575
so you're normally fighting
through the crowds.

405
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:25,978
That's been a difficulty
on the sets.

406
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:28,480
Rolling!
Nice and quiet.

407
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:30,551
( speaks Croatian )

408
00:17:31,095 --> 00:17:32,730
- Roll camera.
- Rolling!

409
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:36,221
- Rolling!
- Sound speed.

410
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,288
17, take one,

411
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,288
C marker only.

412
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,693
And, action!

413
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:46,999
I don't think this is
a good idea, Your Grace.

414
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,701
Nonsense, Ser Meryn.
These are deeply
religious people.

415
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:51,770
Where can I find
the High Sparrow?

416
00:18:01,028 --> 00:18:02,729
( man coughs )

417
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:05,484
- Director: Cut. Cut.
- Man: Cut!

418
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,588
- Why did you do that?
- I don't believe you did that!

419
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,423
Are you all right?

420
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,492
- Wanker.
- That's it,
we're on strike.

421
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:15,260
No, we're on strike.
Fuck you. Go on.

422
00:18:15,026 --> 00:18:18,230
You get into
the fucking pelican.
See how you like it.

423
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:20,399
( groans )

424
00:18:21,004 --> 00:18:23,206
( coughs )
No?

425
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,370
- Cut.
- You know what?

426
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:27,073
I can't even lift--
I can't lift my arm

427
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:28,874
- 'cause it's like a T-rex.
- Hit me, come on.

428
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:30,342
You think you're
fucking tough?
Come on.

429
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:32,211
Come on, harder.
Come on, harder.

430
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:34,847
( bell tolling )

431
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:43,122
Newman:
Belfast remains the heart
of the whole thing.

432
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,824
It's a major city,
so we have all the things

433
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:48,293
that a big film crew need.

434
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,929
But, you know, you drive
20 minutes out of the city

435
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:52,898
and you're in the heart
of the countryside.

436
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:55,300
It helps with the ancient
feel of the show

437
00:18:55,003 --> 00:18:57,606
that the landscape has
a feeling of being old.

438
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:00,372
It's been worn down
and eroded.

439
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:03,909
And everything has
that ancient feel to it
no matter where you go.

440
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:07,312
You know, the woods feel old,
the cliff tops feel old,

441
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:10,916
and the moorlands
certainly look old,
you know.

442
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,951
I always like to go
to the set every day

443
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:15,254
because that's been
my heart.

444
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:17,990
This is my 40th year
in the film business

445
00:19:17,099 --> 00:19:19,234
and my heart has always
been in making a film.

446
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,760
I've always loved the set.

447
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:23,245
You can always kind of tell

448
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:23,245
how the day is going

449
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:28,300
by the way Chris

450
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:28,300
is standing and looking
at everyone around set.

451
00:19:28,003 --> 00:19:30,072
( laughing )

452
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,838
Newman:
I have no idea.
Some of them look at my face

453
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,140
and think if it's looking
very long, we must be
in trouble,

454
00:19:35,014 --> 00:19:36,449
but that's not the case.

455
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,911
I might be thinking about
something entirely different.

456
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,679
I always find him
very calm and very relaxed

457
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,686
given that he's producing
this massive, epic show.

458
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:46,776
Newman:
We shoot this year
120 days.

459
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:50,656
But in those 120 days,
we do shoot two units,

460
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:52,257
so you double it.

461
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:56,361
You're effectively shooting
240 days of screen time.

462
00:19:58,096 --> 00:20:01,667
( speaking Valyrian )

463
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:04,724
Today on set
I'm mostly concerned
with the Valyrian.

464
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:07,439
We have a scene
with the Valyrian language in,

465
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:09,007
so I'm looking after
the actors

466
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:11,276
and making sure
that they feel comfortable
with their lines.

467
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:13,353
'Cause some
of the sounds are quite
tricky to get through.

468
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,615
Director:
All right, guys.
Here we go. Shooting.

469
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:18,450
Let's have it quiet.

470
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:21,019
Let's roll cameras, please.

471
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:23,855
Man:
Rolling.

472
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:25,257
Director:
Action.

473
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,226
I didn't conquer them.
Their own people did.

474
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,394
( man speaking Valyrian )

475
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,297
( speaking Valyrian )

476
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:36,401
Find the men who did this
and bring them to me.

477
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:40,653
- Your Grace.
- And cut it.

478
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:44,109
Let's go one more time.
Hey, Sean, I think...

479
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:10,936
Welter Soler:
Right now, we are
in a town called Osuna.

480
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,405
And it has this
beautiful old bull ring

481
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:15,540
and it's a national
monument as well.

482
00:21:15,054 --> 00:21:17,323
When we walked
into this bull ring,

483
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:19,611
it was just the place
they were looking for.

484
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:23,782
The stone is quite similar
to the stone they have
shot in Croatia.

485
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,251
- Made some great progress.
- Yes.

486
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:28,328
Welter Soler:
This does not have
to be a bull ring.

487
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,689
It needs to be something
completely different,

488
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:34,026
and that's why we need
to transform it into
that place.

489
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:37,963
Building the balcony
where the actors are going
to go to the ground.

490
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,165
We had to cover up
all the pillars.

491
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:42,301
There will be a lot
of things added to that.

492
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,037
We're shooting just one
single scene in here

493
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:47,606
and it's 12 days.
It's quite complex.

494
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:50,663
There's a lot
of action happening
and we need that time.

495
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:53,578
The pressure is so high
to meet the expectancies

496
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:55,847
of what is involved
in there.

497
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:57,749
It was just incredible.

498
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:07,659
All right, ladies and gents,

499
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:07,659
thank you very much.

500
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,428
- That's a wrap for today.

501
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,428
- ( bell rings )

502
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:11,530
Quiet down, people.
Listen, clear the cameras,

503
00:22:11,053 --> 00:22:12,921
clear the lights,
the equipment.

504
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:18,103
Newman:
Here was a very stable,

505
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:20,572
interesting day
for the character Daenerys.

506
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:23,609
And then, of course,
we had the big trip out
to see the set of Hardhome

507
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:25,877
and it did open up
a lot of questions

508
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:28,780
which will continue to be
looked at in weeks to come.

509
00:22:28,078 --> 00:22:30,614
You do the best you can,
get everything as ready
as you can,

510
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:33,185
and then you cross
your fingers.

511
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:37,489
Caulfield:

512
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:37,489
Today went very well.

513
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:39,658
We finished our work.
David and Dan were happy,

514
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:41,893
which is always
my goal of the day

515
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:43,528
when they come out
with a smile.

516
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:46,465
Chris and I will talk
and compare notes.

517
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:50,902
Another two days down.
That's the beauty of shooting
two units every day.

518
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:52,971
It's the only job
that can live two
days in one.

519
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:54,906
( laughs )

520
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:57,743
Muggoch:

521
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:57,743
At the moment, the main thing
I'm thinking about

522
00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:59,044
is getting out of Croatia.

523
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,846
We've got a lot of stuff
to move to Spain,

524
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:03,615
so that's where all
my thought is going
at the moment.

525
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:06,752
And obviously trying to set up
Spain at the same time.

526
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,253
Yeah.

527
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:10,489
And getting through
every day of filming.

528
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:13,586
( chuckles )
And knowing that there's
big scenes coming up.

529
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:16,561
- Yeah.
- Man: So it doesn't stop?

530
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,196
No, it doesn't stop, no.

531
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:23,435
Welter Soler:

532
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:23,435
Every day there are things
that you don't expect.

533
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:26,104
Not having shot with

534
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:26,104
any of the crew before

535
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:27,839
obviously increases
the stress level.

536
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:30,008
- Hello, Croatia.
- Muggoch: Hello, Spain.

537
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:31,710
So, how is it
all going?

538
00:23:31,071 --> 00:23:34,474
Welter Soler:
As much as the shooting date
is moving closer

539
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:37,482
and everybody is aware
more and more of the fact

540
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:39,584
that we have less time,

541
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,453
yeah, stress level
is increasing.

542
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:43,221
Definitely.
Definitely.

543
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:55,300
Welter Soler:
Production arriving
in the past 10 days

544
00:23:55,003 --> 00:23:56,438
was actually very good.

545
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:59,304
There was a lot
of people rolling up.

546
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:02,307
There's probably 450 people
working behind the camera.

547
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:04,109
Director:
All right, let's roll
cameras, please.

548
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,944
- Man: Rolling!
- Man #2: Let's roll camera!

549
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:09,481
- ( clapper snaps )
- Director: And background
action.

550
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:11,783
Welter Soler:
The first day of shooting
is always crucial to us

551
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,885
because it shows us
if everything we did

552
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:16,988
in order to prepare it
was the right thing.

553
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,432
( crowd cheering )

554
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:36,541
( shouting )

555
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,147
Director:
Okay, here we go.

556
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,115
And, action!

557
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:46,551
( shouting )

558
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:50,255
This year, Belfast has got
some big sets like Hardhome

559
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:53,358
and the art department
and construction have done
a really great job

560
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:56,661
of turning what was a notion
into reality.

561
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:29,494
( music playing )
